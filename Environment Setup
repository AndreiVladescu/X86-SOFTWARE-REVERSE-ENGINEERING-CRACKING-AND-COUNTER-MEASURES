There are two types of environments needed for the labs. Windows and Linux.

We reccomomend performing all labs in a virtual machine, while none of the code provided in the labs is intentionally malicious. It is always best practice to do security testing, and learning in an isolated enviornment.

Windows - Any modern version of Windows
Linux - We reccomend Ubuntu, as all labs were designed and testing in Ubuntu. If you have a passion for other linux distro's you're welcome to try them out but we offer no guarantees.
