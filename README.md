Welcome!

We are excited you've chosen to embark on the enjoyable journey of learning x86 software cracking and countermeasures! Hands on learning is a powerful technique for really solidifying new learnings. We have built a range of labs to act as companion learning opportunities throughout the book. 

Prior to attempting any labs please check out the 'Lab Environment Setup' to make sure you have an appropriate setup to complete the labs.

For links to the downloads of tools used in the labs, and referenced in the book please check out 'Tools'

Each of the labs is standalone, so completion of one is not a prerequisite of a subsequent lab.
